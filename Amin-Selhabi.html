        <h2>Brokerage Information System</h2>
        <h5>Software Architecture and Design</h5>
        <p>
          I proposed a design for the Messaging Infrastructure layer of the new Brokerage Information System (BIS) for
          BizCo company, alongside my colleague Moaz. The objective was to select a pattern, instantiate it, and modify
          the architecture to fulfill the quality attribute requirements of the company.

        <h1>Online Parking Reservation for the University of Jeddah</h1>
        <h5>Software Project Managements</h5>
        <p>
          The project, with the collaboration of colleagues Nawaf Mohammed Ibrahim, Omar Alzhrani, and Muath Saad,
          incorporates Software Project Management methodologies. Together, we ensure the successful execution of the
          Online Parking Reservation System. The process involves project initiation, planning, execution, monitoring,
          and control to deliver the system within the defined scope, timeline, and budget. Effective project management
          practices, including requirement gathering, system design and development, testing, deployment, and
          maintenance, are employed collectively to meet the project's objectives and stakeholder expectations.

        <h5>Human-Computer interaction</h5>
        <p>
          The project, led by me and my colleagues Anmar Hani, Sameer Ahmad Awaji, Nawaf Mohammed Ibrahim, and Mohammed
          Adel Alsaadwi, emphasizes Human-Computer Interaction principles. Our goal is to create a user-friendly
          interface for the online parking reservation system. The design meticulously focuses on usability,
          accessibility, and efficiency to ensure a seamless user experience. By considering user needs, preferences,
          and feedback, the system aims to simplify the process of reserving parking slots, enhancing user satisfaction
          and engagement.
