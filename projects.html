                <h2>Software Architecture and Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I proposed a design for the Messaging Infrastructure layer of the new Brokerage Information System
                    (BIS) for
                    BizCo company, alongside my colleague Moaz. The objective was to select a pattern, instantiate it,
                    and modify
                    the architecture to fulfill the quality attribute requirements of the company.

                            The project, with the collaboration of colleagues Nawaf Mohammed Ibrahim, Omar Alzhrani, and

                            Saad,
                            incorporates Software Project Management methodologies. Together, we ensure the successful
                            execution
                            of the
                            Online Parking Reservation System. The process involves project initiation, planning,
                            execution,
                            monitoring,
                            and control to deliver the system within the defined scope, timeline, and budget. Effective

                            The project, led by me and my colleagues Anmar Hani, Sameer Ahmad Awaji, Nawaf Mohammed
                            Ibrahim,

                            Adel Alsaadwi, emphasizes Human-Computer Interaction principles. Our goal is to create a
                            user-friendly
                            interface for the online parking reservation system. The design meticulously focuses on
                            usability,
                            accessibility, and efficiency to ensure a seamless user experience. By considering user
                            needs,
                            preferences,
                            and feedback, the system aims to simplify the process of reserving parking slots, enhancing
                            user
                            satisfaction
                            and engagement.
